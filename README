WORK IN PROGRESS

This plugin is part of: https://github.com/CESNET/ipfixcol2

THIS PLUGIN NOW DEPENDS ON THE LIBFDS LIBRARY!

Right now, when you use IPFIXcol2 with the json output plugin, every field of every IPFIX message will be
parsed into the json output. Sometimes you want parse only some of the fields located in IPFIX massages
(for example: you are only interested in Src/Dst ip adresses). This plugin aims to resolve this issue.

Goals:
	-Reduce the parsed output to those fields which the user selects
	-Integration of alliases (for example: instead of the field "iana:sourceIPv4Address" which is pretty 
	non readable you can specify this fields as "ipsrc")
	-The previous example brings up a problem when your traffic consists of IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Which 
	one to select ? Auto detection of used IP protocol will be used in this instance, and the output will
	be formated accordingly (for example: if you specify the field "ipsrc" then packets containing IPv4 will
	be parsed into "ipsrc":"x.x.x.x" and packets containing IPv6 will be parse into "ipsrc":"x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x")
